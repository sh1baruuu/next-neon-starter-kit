### ‚öôÔ∏è Neon & Drizzle ORM Setup

This starter kit uses [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) to manage your database schema and migrations with Neon.

#### 1. Create a Neon Database

* Sign up for a free [Neon](https://neon.tech/) account.
* Create a new project and a new database.
* Go to the project dashboard and copy the **Connection String** for your database. It should look something like `postgresql://...`.

#### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

* Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project.
* Add your database connection string to this file:
    ```env
    DATABASE_URL="your_neon_connection_string"
    ```

#### 3. Define Your Schema

* Your database schema is defined in `src/db/schema.ts`.
* Modify this file to define your tables and columns.

#### 4. Generate a Migration

* After changing your schema, run the following command to generate a new migration file:
    ```bash
    npm run db:generate
    ```
* This will create a new migration file in the `src/db/migrations` folder, which contains the SQL to update your database.

#### 5. Push to the Database

* Once you're ready, run the following command to apply the migrations and update your database schema:
    ```bash
    npm run db:push
    ```
* Drizzle will automatically run the new migration to sync your database with your schema file.

#### 6. View with Drizzle Studio (Optional)

* To get a visual representation of your database, you can run Drizzle Studio:
    ```bash
    npm run db:studio
    ```
